# Multi-Agent Mode

!!! warning

    **Experimental.** Subagents inherit the parent's model and run in Normal
    mode with workspace restriction and auto-compact enabled. The workspace
    boundary is best-effort — use a container for strong isolation.

## Enabling

```bash
agent --multi-agent
```

Or in config:

```yaml
settings:
  multi_agent: true
```

Disable with `--no-multi-agent` (overrides config).

## How It Works

When enabled, the agent gains five additional tools for spawning and
communicating with subagents:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `spawn_agent` | Launch a subagent with a task prompt |
| `list_agents` | List owned subagents and discovered peers |
| `message_agent` | Send a message to one or more agents |
| `peek_agent` | Query an agent's context without interrupting it |
| `stop_agent` | Terminate a subagent |

## Subagent Behavior

- Inherit the parent's **model** and **reasoning effort**
- Run in **Normal mode** with default permissions
- Have **auto-compact** enabled
- Are **workspace-restricted** to the parent's CWD
- **Persist between turns** — they listen for incoming messages
- **Self-terminate** when their task is complete

Agents get human-readable names (e.g., cedar, birch, plum).

## Depth and Limits

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--max-agent-depth <N>` | 1 | How deep agents can nest (agents can't spawn at max depth) |
| `--max-agents <N>` | 8 | Max concurrent agents per session |

## Peer Discovery

Other interactive agent sessions in the same repository are automatically
discovered via the registry at `~/.local/state/agent/registry/`. You can
communicate with peers using the same `message_agent` and `peek_agent` tools.

## Managing Subagents

Use `/agents` to open a dialog listing all running subagents with their status
and task. From the parent session you can also use `stop_agent` via the model to
terminate a subagent, or `message_agent` / `peek_agent` to interact with it.

The status line shows the number of active subagents when any are running.
